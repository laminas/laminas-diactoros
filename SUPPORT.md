# Getting Support

Laminas offers the following support channels:

- For real-time questions, use our [chat](https://laminas.dev/chat)
- For detailed questions (e.g., those requiring examples) use our [forums](https://discourse.laminas.dev)
- To report issues, use this repository's [issue tracker](https://github.com/laminas/laminas-zendframework-bridge/issues/new)

Please **DO NOT** use the issue tracker to ask questions. 
Instead, use chat or the forums for that. 
Questions posed to the issue tracker will be closed.

When reporting an issue, please include the following details:

- A narrative description of what you are trying to accomplish.
- The minimum code necessary to reproduce the issue.
- The expected results of exercising that code.
- The actual results received.

We may ask for additional details: what version of the library you are using, and what PHP version was used to reproduce the issue.

You may also submit a failing test case as a pull request.
